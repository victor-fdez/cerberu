Raw milk and why I want it

I have tried making cheese - especifically Mozarella Cheese - with the most popular local brand 
of milk (Price's Whole Milk, El Paso). This milk happens to be homogenized and pauterized like
most milk around the country. This process, especially homogenization changes the structure
of the milk by breaking fat globules into smaller globules by passing milk at very high pressure
through small holes.
